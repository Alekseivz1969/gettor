#~ "    Hello! This is the \"GetTor\" robot.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    Here's your requested software as a zip file. Please unzip the\n"
#~ "    package and verify the signature.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    IMPORTANT NOTE:\n"
#~ "    Since this is part of a split-file request, you need to wait for\n"
#~ "    all split files to be received by you before you can save them all\n"
#~ "    into the same directory and unpack them by double-clicking the\n"
#~ "    first file.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    Packages might come out of order! Please make sure you received\n"
#~ "    all packages before you attempt to unpack them!\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    Hint: If your computer has GnuPG installed, use the gpg\n"
#~ "    commandline tool as follows after unpacking the zip file:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "       gpg --verify <packagename>.asc <packagename>\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    The output should look somewhat like this:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "       gpg: Good signature from \"Roger Dingledine <arma@mit.edu>\"\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    If you're not familiar with commandline tools, try looking for\n"
#~ "    a graphical user interface for GnuPG on this website:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "       http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/frontends.html\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    If your Internet connection blocks access to the Tor network, you\n"
#~ "    may need a bridge relay. Bridge relays (or \"bridges\" for short)\n"
#~ "    are Tor relays that aren't listed in the main directory. Since there\n"
#~ "    is no complete public list of them, even if your ISP is filtering\n"
#~ "    connections to all the known Tor relays, they probably won't be able\n"
#~ "    to block all the bridges.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    You can acquire a bridge by sending an email that contains \"get bridges"
#~ "\"\n"
#~ "    in the body of the email to the following email address:\n"
#~ "    bridges@torproject.org\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    It is also possible to fetch bridges with a web browser at the "
#~ "following\n"
#~ "    url: https://bridges.torproject.org/\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    If you have any questions or it doesn't work, you can contact a\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "    重要提示：\n"
#~ "    由于您服务商的邮件体积限制，文件已分割发送，\n"
#~ "    您需要等待所有子文件包到齐后将它们一并保存至\n"
