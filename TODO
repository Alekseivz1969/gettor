These are planned changes to the gettor system.

Localization of gettor for local logging messages:
    - Localize all log messages
    - We'll want to read the default language from the config file
        - We should fall back into English for now
    - Make logging configurable
        - Syslog or user suggested file
            - An option (default) for no logging at all
        - Any logging should make use of scrubbing functions.
            - Hash private information (e.g. emailaddresses)

Localization of gettor output for messages sent to users:
    - Localize the language of outgoing mail messages
        - We need a method of fetching the user's preference
            - Perhaps for now a field that specifies a locale?
    - Do we want to set a preference or make it per email?
        - For now, lets set it per email
