gettor is a program for serving Tor and Tor related files over SMTP.
Users interface with gettor by sending it an email. The users must use a mail
server that signs outgoing mail with DKIM. This is to prevent abuse.
The following document explains how to setup gettor for a server admin.

To use gettor, you'll want a machine that invokes .forward files for users.
You'll also want to have python and rsync installed.

As an example, for the user 'gettor' we have the following files:

Your .forward file should look like this:

    gettor@moria:~$ cat .forward 
    "|/home/gettor/bin/gettor.py"

These are the python files we need to run gettor.py:

    gettor@moria:~/bin$ ls
    dkim.py              gettor_log.py       gettor.py
    gettor_blacklist.py  gettor_opt.py       gettor_requests.py
    gettor_config.py     gettor_packages.py  gettor_responses.py

Once you have everything installed, you'll want to initalize the file store:

    gettor@moria:~/newbin$ ./gettor.py -f -p

You should see an rsync and finally something like:

    sent 1637 bytes  received 415792532 bytes  9558486.64 bytes/sec
    total size is 415735925  speedup is 1.00

    2009-01-05 16:49:29,226 (9222) Syncing Tor packages done.
    2009-01-05 16:49:30,155 (9222) Building packages done.
    2009-01-05 16:49:30,155 (9222) Building packages done.

Now you'll install the cronjob. This clears the blacklist and updates 
packages daily:

    gettor@moria:~/bin$ ./gettor.py -i

Now gettor.py is installed, prepared and ready to serve files. Send it email!
