These are planned changes to the gettor system.

- Testing and proposals to better support users with limited email bandwidth
  (multi-part download, etc.).
- Split (at least) tiger bundle into several smaller archives to avoid ~20MB
- Add more translations
    - Freeze messages for translation
    - Put po files into pootle for translation
- Package names that are sent out to the user are currently hard-coded. Return
  to a more dynamic approach, also: Add a nice little note about the size of 
  the files users may request
- Fix rsync to follow symlinks properly. We want the data not a link to data.
- Remove 'localhost:25' to send mail and use '/usr/bin/sendmail' instead
  (suggested by weasel)
- Implement test (-t switch) functionality
- Add torbutton (Mike, please sign torbutton and populate a proper .asc)
- Add GetTor to GetTor and it will be able to distribute itself
