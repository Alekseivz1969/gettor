These are planned changes to the gettor system.

Localization of all message strings:
    - We need to implement the gnu gettext _("") code for *all* print functions
        - A user can explictly set their program to 'stdout' if they want to test

Fix file logging:
        - Currently logging to a file isn't implemented
            - python lacks a way to do proper semaphores (ipc fail)
        - Any logging should make use of scrubbing functions.
            - Hash private information (e.g. emailaddresses)

Localization of gettor output for messages sent to users:
    - Localize the language of outgoing mail messages
        - We need a method of fetching the user's preference
            - Perhaps for now a field that specifies a locale?
    - Do we want to set a preference or make it per email?
        - For now, lets set it per email

Allow for file/package configuration in the dotfile
    - We should not hardcode the package names or files

Create options that make gettor less ghetto:
    - Add an option to allow selecting of a specific Tor mirror
        "--use-mirror"
    - Add proxy support for fetching
    - Add an option to add a crontab to update a packages directory
        "--install-crontab"
        - Test that rsync and cron are enabled
        - Ensure that this option selects a random time to rsync data
    - Add an option to fetch packages from a given mirror
        "--fetch-packages"
    - Add an option to zip up all files in the packages directory
        "--prep-packages"
    - Automatically generate package list and create proper config stanza lines
        - Currently blocked by our inability to configure package names
        "--generate-package-list"
    - Add an option that runs a series of tests confirming everything is OK
        "--run-tests"
        - Show the user all of the results
    - Add an option that implements all of this in one easy step
        "--setup"
        - An alias for "--run-tests --fetch-packages --prep-packages \
            --generate-package-list --install-crontab"

Create an explicit whitelist configuration option:
    - We should ensure that we never block certain users
        - Even without DKIM
