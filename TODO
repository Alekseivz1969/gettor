These are planned changes to the gettor system.

- Testing and proposals to better support users with limited email bandwidth
  (multi-part download, etc.).
- Write spec for how locale requests shall be formatted and parsed
- Implement test (-t switch) functionality
- Fix setup.py installer!
- Split (at least) tiger bundle into several smaller archives to avoid ~20MB
- Add more translations
    - Freeze messages for translation
    - Put po files into pootle for translation
- Add GetTor to GetTor and it will be able to distribute itself
- Better exception catching when the local SMTP rejects the email
    - Perhaps we want to email the admin of GetTor with the error?
    - Perhaps we want to respond to the user with a useful message?
- Add torbutton (Mike, please sign torbutton and populate a proper .asc)
- Update the README to fix the XXX issues
- Fix rsync to follow symlinks properly. We want the data not a link to data.
- Add a nice little note about the size of the files users may request
