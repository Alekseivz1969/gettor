These are planned changes to the gettor system.

- Split constants.py text into smaller strings, also update the text to reflect
  split-file download instructions
- Finalize split downloads:
    - Rename the .exe file for split downloads to .ex_RENAME
    - Split (at least) tiger bundle into several smaller archives to avoid ~20MB
- Remove deprecated 'MimeWriter' and use python email module instead
- Clean distdir and packdir on each fetching/packaging run
- Write instructions on the website on how to use GetTor. Put that site into
  pootle for translation so for example chinese and iranian users have a
  reference for help
- Package names that are sent out to the user are currently hard-coded. Return
  to a more dynamic approach, also: Add a nice little note about the size of 
  the files users may request
- Remove 'localhost:25' to send mail and use '/usr/bin/sendmail' instead
  (suggested by weasel)
- Implement test (-t switch) functionality
- Add torbutton (Mike, please sign torbutton and populate a proper .asc)
- Add GetTor to GetTor and it will be able to distribute itself
