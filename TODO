These are planned changes to the gettor system.

- Testing and proposals to better support users with limited email bandwidth 
  (multi-part download, etc.).
- Write spec for how locale requests shall be formatted and parsed
- Implement test (-t switch) functionality
- Installer
- Rename the library modules and move them to something like lib/ so that only
  the gettor.py executable stays in the top-level dir
- Enhance README file
- Automatically parse .po files and move the .mo files to their proper place
