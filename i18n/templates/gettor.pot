"    Hello! This is the \"GetTor\" robot.\n"
"\n"
"    Unfortunately, we won't answer you at this address. You should make\n"
"    an account with GMAIL.COM or YAHOO.CN and send the mail from\n"
"    one of those.\n"
"\n"
"    We only process requests from email services that support \"DKIM\",\n"
"    which is an email feature that lets us verify that the address in the\n"
"    \"From\" line is actually the one who sent the mail.\n"
"\n"
"    (We apologize if you didn't ask for this mail. Since your email is from\n"
"    a service that doesn't use DKIM, we're sending a short explanation,\n"
"    and then we'll ignore this email address for the next day or so.)\n"
"\n"
"    Please note that currently, we can't process HTML emails or base 64\n"
"    mails. You will need to send plain text.\n"
"\n"
"    If you have any questions or it doesn't work, you can contact a\n"

"    Hello, This is the \"GetTor\" robot.\n"
"\n"
"    I will mail you a Tor package, if you tell me which one you want.\n"
"    Please select one of the following package names:\n"
"\n"
"        tor-browser-bundle\n"
"        macosx-i386-bundle\n"
"        macosx-ppc-bundle\n"
"        tor-im-browser-bundle\n"
"        source-bundle\n"

"    OBTAINING LOCALIZED VERSIONS OF TOR\n"
"    ===================================\n"
"\n"
"    Please note that GetTor can send out localized versions of Tor.\n"
"\n"
"    Obtaining localized Tor via 'plus' addresses:\n"
"    --------------------------------------------\n"
"\n"
"    There are two ways how to receive localized versions of Tor. The \n"
"    first and easiest is to send us email to a 'plus' address like so:\n"
"\n"
"        gettor+zh_CN@torproject.org\n"
"\n"
"    This will for exmaple give you the requested package in a localized\n"
"    version for chinese. Check below for a list of supported language \n"
"    codes.\n"
"\n"
"    Obtaining localized Tor via 'Lang' code:\n"
"    ---------------------------------------\n"
"\n"
"    The other way to receive a localized Tor package is the following:\n"
"\n"
"    In your mail to us, please add a line containing \"Lang:\" followed by\n"
"    the language abbreviation like so:\n"
"\n"
"        Lang: language\n"
"\n"
"    For example if you want the tor-browser-bundle for in chinese, write\n"
"    us an email with the following text:\n"
"\n"
"        tor-browser-bundle\n"
"        Lang: zh_CN\n"
"\n"
"    Or, if you want the tor-browser-bundle in farsi, write us an email\n"
"    with the following text:\n"
"\n"
"        tor-browser-bundle\n"
"        Lang: fa\n"
"\n"
"    List of supported locales:\n"
"    -------------------------\n"
"\n"
"    Here is a list of all available languages:\n"
"\n"
"    ar:     Arabic\n"
"    de:     German\n"
"    en:     English\n"
"    es:     Spanish\n"
"    fa:     Farsi (Iran)\n"
"    fr:     French\n"

"\n"
"    Here's your requested software as a zip file. Please unzip the\n"
"    package and verify the signature.\n"
"\n"
"    Hint: If your computer has GnuPG installed, use the gpg\n"
"    commandline tool as follows after unpacking the zip file:\n"
"\n"
"       gpg --verify <packagename>.asc <packagename>\n"

"    If your Internet connection blocks access to the Tor network, you\n"

"    are Tor relays that aren't listed in the main directory. Since there\n"

"    connections to all the known Tor relays, they probably won't be able\n"

"\n"
"    You can acquire a bridge by sending an email that contains \"get bridges"
