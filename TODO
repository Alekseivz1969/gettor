These are planned changes to the gettor system.

- Investigate the usage of gettor+lang@torproject.org email addresses for 
  letting users choose a reply and tor package language
- Testing and proposals to better support users with limited email bandwidth
  (multi-part download, etc.).
- Split (at least) tiger bundle into several smaller archives to avoid ~20MB
- Add more translations
    - Freeze messages for translation
    - Put po files into pootle for translation
- Think about opening up GetTor to non-DKIM users because Gmail & co are 
  blocked in Iran:
    - One option would be to use a "3 way handshake" to send out packages:
        1. User sends in request
        2. We send them a 'did you really want this package?' mail
        3. User replies to that mail and we send out the package
    - Just send out packages to everyone without asking (Potential DoS of moria
      and every Inbox around the globe)
    - ???
- Write instructions on the website on how to use GetTor. Put that site into
  pootle for translation so for example chinese and iranian users have a
  reference for help
- Package names that are sent out to the user are currently hard-coded. Return
  to a more dynamic approach, also: Add a nice little note about the size of 
  the files users may request
- Fix rsync to follow symlinks properly. We want the data not a link to data.
- Remove 'localhost:25' to send mail and use '/usr/bin/sendmail' instead
  (suggested by weasel)
- Implement test (-t switch) functionality
- Add torbutton (Mike, please sign torbutton and populate a proper .asc)
- Add GetTor to GetTor and it will be able to distribute itself
